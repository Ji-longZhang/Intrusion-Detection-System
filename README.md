Project name: Intrusion Detection System 

Place: Institute of Informatics and communication, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi.

Intrusion Detection in Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks. This project aims at implementing the IDS. This system is divided in five modules.

i. Constructing the Network

ii. Packet Creation

iii. Find authorized and un authorized port

iv. Constructing Inter-Domain Packet Filters

v. Receiving the valid packet

MODULE DESCRIPTIONS

Module 1:

In this module, we are going to connect the network .Each node is connected the neighboring node and it is independently deployed in network area. And also deploy the each port no is authorized in a node.

Module 2:

In this module, browse and select the source file. And selected data is converted into fixed size of packets. And the packet is sent from source to detector.

Module 3:

The intrusion detection is defined as a mechanism for a network to detect the existence of inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous moving attackers. In this module check whether the path is authorized or unauthorized. If path is authorized the packet is send to valid destination. Otherwise the packet will be deleted. According to port number only we are going to find the path is authorized or Unauthorized.

Module 4:

If the packet is received from port other than the valid port number, it will be filtered and discarded. This filter only removes the unauthorized packets and authorized packets send to destination.

Module 5:

In this module, after filtering the invalid packets all the valid packets will reach the destination.
